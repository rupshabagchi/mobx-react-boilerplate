mobx-react-boilerplate
=====================

A minimal application that combines [MobX](https://mobxjs.github.io/mobx) with [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).
Supports ES6 and JSX compilation and linting through babel, and testing through enzyme and jest. Built on top of the original Mobx boilerplate.

* Support for React-Hot-Loader can be found in the [`with-hot-loader`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-boilerplate/tree/with-hot-loader) branch
* For a typescript based boilerplate, see [`mobx-react-typescript-boilerplate`](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-react-typescript-boilerplate)
